# CS503 VI_Curiosity_Project

This repository contains our implementation of assessing the properties of Pathak et al's definition of curiosity under permutation of state space in two environments:
- the Pyramid game from the Unity environment
- the Mario game from the Gymnasium environment

## **Installation**  
To begin the experiments, you first need to install the required packages and dependencies. To do this, please run the [setup_env.sh](setup_env.sh) script.

```bash
bash setup_env.sh
```

## **Pyramid environment**
To work in the Pyramid environment, you can either take the original environment from Unity:
- download the Unity Game Engine ([Unity Hub]([url](https://unity.com/fr/download)))
- in the Unity Game Engine, download the recommanded editor version 6000.1.1f1
- clone the [ml-agent github]([url](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)) with
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents.git
```
